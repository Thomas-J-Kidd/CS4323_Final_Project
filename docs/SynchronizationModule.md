# SynchronizationModule Class Documentation

The `SynchronizationModule` class is a foundational component in the system, designed to facilitate synchronized access to shared resources across concurrent processes. It employs mutexes and condition variables to manage resource access, ensuring that only one process can use a resource at a time, thereby preventing race conditions and ensuring data consistency.

## Overview

`SynchronizationModule` offers a mechanism to control access to shared resources identified by a unique `ResourceId`. It ensures that concurrent processes do not interfere with each other's operations on shared resources. The module uses a combination of mutexes and condition variables to provide exclusive access and to coordinate the execution order of processes.

## Functions

### `void lockResource(const ResourceId& resourceId, const std::string& processId)`

- Acquires a lock on the specified resource for the calling process.
- If the resource is already locked by another process, the calling process is added to a wait queue and sleeps until it is its turn to acquire the resource.
- Ensures that resource access is granted in the order that processes request it, preventing starvation and ensuring fairness.

### `void unlockResource(const ResourceId& resourceId, const std::string& processId)`

- Releases the lock held by the calling process on the specified resource.
- If there are other processes waiting for the resource, the next process in the queue is notified and given access to the resource.
- Outputs a log message indicating the process has released the resource.

### `void waitForCondition(const ResourceId& resourceId)`

- A utility function that allows a process to wait on a specific condition variable associated with a resource.
- This function can be used for more advanced synchronization patterns where simply locking and unlocking is insufficient.

### `void notify(const ResourceId& resourceId)`

- Notifies one waiting process that it can proceed, typically used after a change in resource state that might interest waiting processes.

### `void notifyAll(const ResourceId& resourceId)`

- Notifies all waiting processes that they can proceed, used when a state change affects all processes waiting on the resource's condition variable.

## How Functions Interact

- Processes call `lockResource` to request access to a shared resource. If the resource is available, the process proceeds; if not, the process is placed in a wait queue.
- Once a process has finished its operation on the shared resource, it calls `unlockResource` to release its lock, allowing the next process in the queue to access the resource.
- `waitForCondition`, `notify`, and `notifyAll` provide additional control for more complex synchronization scenarios, allowing processes to wait for specific conditions or be notified about state changes.

## Extensibility and Modification

The `SynchronizationModule` is designed to be a versatile component in the system architecture:

- **Adding New Synchronization Patterns**: The module can be extended to support more complex synchronization patterns as needed by the system.
- **Optimization**: The implementation can be optimized for specific use cases or to improve efficiency in high-contention environments.
- **Enhanced Logging**: The module's logging can be expanded to provide more detailed insights into synchronization behavior, aiding in debugging and performance analysis.

## TODO List for Future Development

While the `SynchronizationModule` provides a solid foundation for resource synchronization, several enhancements can be made:

### 1. Dynamic Resource Management

- Implement functionality to dynamically create and destroy resource monitors as needed, improving resource utilization.

### 2. Deadlock Detection

- Integrate deadlock detection mechanisms to identify and resolve potential deadlocks in the system.

### 3. Improved Logging and Monitoring

- Enhance the logging system to provide more detailed and actionable insights into synchronization events and resource contention.

### 4. Efficiency Improvements

- Optimize internal data structures and algorithms to reduce lock contention and improve throughput in high-load scenarios.

### 5. Extended Testing

- Develop comprehensive tests to cover various synchronization scenarios, ensuring the module's reliability and robustness.

### 6. Documentation and Usage Examples

- Provide detailed documentation and examples demonstrating how to use the module effectively in different scenarios, aiding developers in integrating synchronization into their processes.

The `SynchronizationModule` is crucial for ensuring that concurrent processes interact with shared resources in a safe and orderly manner, providing a cornerstone for building reliable and efficient multi-process applications.
