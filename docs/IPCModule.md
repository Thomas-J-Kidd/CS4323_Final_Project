# IPCModule Class Documentation

The `IPCModule` class is a core component in the system's inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism, specifically designed to handle shared memory operations with concurrent access management. It collaborates closely with the `SharedMemorySegment` class and the `SynchronizationModule` to ensure safe and synchronized access to shared data resources, crucial in a multi-processing environment.

## Overview

`IPCModule` facilitates inter-process communication by providing an interface to record and read transactions in shared memory. It ensures that concurrent access to shared memory segments is properly managed to prevent data corruption and race conditions. The class uses a `SharedMemorySegment` instance to store data and a `SynchronizationModule` instance to handle synchronization across different processes.

## Functions

### Constructor: `IPCModule()`

- Instantiates a new `IPCModule` object.
- The constructor is straightforward, primarily setting up the module for future operations without any initial logic.

### `void recordTransaction(const std::string& processId, const std::string& segmentId, const std::string& transactionType, const std::string& accountNumber, double amount, const std::string& status)`

- Records a transaction in a specified shared memory segment.
- Locks the segment using `SynchronizationModule` to ensure exclusive access while updating.
- Formats and stores transaction details in the shared memory segment, then releases the lock.

### `std::string readTransaction(const std::string& processId, const std::string& segmentId)`

- Reads the transaction data from a specified shared memory segment.
- Locks the segment to prevent concurrent modifications while reading.
- Returns the transaction data as a string and then unlocks the segment.

## Interaction with Other Classes

- **SharedMemorySegment**: `IPCModule` uses this class to manage the underlying data storage in shared memory. It handles the creation, updating, and reading of shared memory segments.
- **SynchronizationModule**: This module is used by `IPCModule` to synchronize access to shared memory segments, ensuring that only one process can modify or read a segment at a time.

## Extensibility and Modification

The design of `IPCModule` supports future enhancements and modifications:

- **Enhanced Transaction Management**: New features can be added to handle more complex transaction types or to extend the functionality of current transaction management.
- **Improved Synchronization**: While the current implementation uses a basic locking mechanism, future versions could implement more sophisticated synchronization strategies, especially in high-concurrency environments.
- **Scalability Enhancements**: The module can be optimized to handle larger volumes of transactions and more frequent access from multiple processes.

## TODO List for Future Development

While `IPCModule` is functional, there are several areas where it can be enhanced to improve performance, usability, and maintainability:

### 1. Advanced Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error handling to manage scenarios where shared memory access or synchronization fails.

### 2. Performance Optimization

- Optimize the shared memory access and synchronization mechanisms to handle high-load scenarios more efficiently.

### 3. Security Improvements

- Assess and enhance the security aspects, ensuring that the shared memory communication is safeguarded against unauthorized access.

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring and Logging

- Introduce detailed logging and monitoring capabilities to track the module's operation and help diagnose issues in complex multi-process environments.

### 5. Extensive Testing

- Develop a robust suite of tests to validate the functionality and reliability of the IPC mechanisms, particularly focusing on concurrency and synchronization aspects.

### 6. Documentation and Examples

- Provide comprehensive documentation and usage examples to assist developers in integrating and leveraging the `IPCModule` in their applications.

The `IPCModule` class is instrumental in managing shared memory for IPC, ensuring data integrity and consistency across concurrent processes, which is essential for the stability and reliability of the system's IPC capabilities.
