# ProcessManager Class Documentation

The `ProcessManager` class is a central component of the system, responsible for managing the lifecycle and execution of processes derived from commands. It interacts with other system components like `InputParser`, `InterProcessComs`, and `SynchronizationMonitor` to handle commands effectively and ensure system integrity and performance.

## Overview

`ProcessManager` primarily serves to map specific commands to their corresponding processing logic, creating an organized and scalable way to handle diverse system operations. It leverages C++'s standard library features, such as maps and functions, to dynamically associate command types with their processing routines.

## Functions

### Constructor: `ProcessManager()`

- Initializes a new instance of the `ProcessManager` class.
- Calls `setupCommandProcessors` internally to map command types to their processing functions.

### `void initialize()`

- Prepares the `ProcessManager` instance for operation.
- In this simplified version, it serves as a placeholder for future enhancements, such as setting up dependencies on `InterProcessComs` and `SynchronizationMonitor`.

### `void processCommands(InputParser& parser)`

- Processes commands parsed by the given `InputParser` instance.
- Iterates through each command obtained from the parser, finding and executing the corresponding command processing function based on the command type.
- Reports errors for unknown command types or failed command executions.

### `void setupCommandProcessors()`

- Private function to initialize the mapping of command types to their respective processing functions.
- Utilizes lambda expressions to associate command strings with member function pointers, facilitating easy addition or modification of command handling logic.

### Command Processing Functions

Each of the following functions corresponds to a specific command type, implementing the logic required to process that command. These functions are mapped to command types in `setupCommandProcessors`.

- **`bool processCreateAccount(const Command& cmd)`**
  - Handles the creation of a new user account.
  - Parameters from `cmd` are used to perform account creation logic.

- **`bool processDeleteAccount(const Command& cmd)`**
  - Processes the deletion of an existing user account.

- (Additional processing functions follow a similar pattern, customized to the requirements of their respective commands.)

## How Functions Interact

- The `processCommands` method serves as the entry point for command processing. It retrieves commands from the `InputParser` and dispatches them to the appropriate processing function based on the command type.
- The mapping established in `setupCommandProcessors` enables dynamic association between command types and processing functions, allowing `processCommands` to execute the correct function for each command.
- Command processing functions (`processCreateAccount`, etc.) are designed to be modular and self-contained, focusing on the specific logic required for each command type. They can be easily modified or extended as the system evolves.

## Extensibility and Modification

The design of `ProcessManager` emphasizes modularity and flexibility, facilitating easy additions or changes to command processing logic:

- **Adding New Commands**: To handle a new command type, add a corresponding processing function and update `setupCommandProcessors` to include the new command-function mapping.
- **Integrating with Other Modules**: Future integration with modules like `InterProcessComs` and `SynchronizationMonitor` can be achieved by enhancing the `initialize` method to set up these dependencies, further leveraging their functionalities within command processing routines.

The `ProcessManager` class plays a pivotal role in ensuring that commands are processed efficiently and effectively, laying the groundwork for a scalable and maintainable system architecture.

## TODO List for Future Development

The `ProcessManager` class, while functional, requires several enhancements and integrations to fully realize the envisioned system architecture. Below is a list of key development tasks:

### 1. Complete Command Processing Functions

- **Implement All Command Functions**: While placeholders for command processing functions are defined, their implementations need to be completed with actual logic corresponding to each command's purpose.

### 2. Integrate InterProcessComs Module

- **IPC Mechanism Setup**: Establish and configure the communication pathways using the `InterProcessComs` module for processes that need to communicate or synchronize their actions.
- **Enhance Command Processing**: Some commands may require inter-process communication (IPC) to complete their tasks. Incorporate IPC logic within the respective command processing functions as needed.

### 3. Incorporate the SynchronizationMonitor Module

- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Ensure that access to shared resources is properly synchronized using the `SynchronizationMonitor`. This is crucial for commands that alter shared data to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.
- **Resource Locking in Commands**: Modify command processing functions to utilize synchronization primitives from the `SynchronizationMonitor` for safe resource access.

### 4. Implement Error Handling and Logging

- **Robust Error Handling**: Develop a comprehensive error handling strategy to manage and respond to errors gracefully, particularly in command processing and IPC.
- **Logging System**: Implement a logging system for tracking system operations, errors, and significant events. This will be invaluable for debugging and monitoring the system's behavior.

### 5. Process Forking and Management

- **Child Process Management**: Refine the logic for forking child processes in command processing functions, ensuring robust process control and cleanup to prevent zombie processes.
- **Return Status Evaluation**: Enhance the system to evaluate and act upon the return status of child processes, facilitating error reporting and retry mechanisms as necessary.

### 6. Security and Validation

- **Input Validation**: Implement validation for command parameters to ensure they meet expected formats and constraints, protecting against invalid or malicious inputs.
- **Security Enhancements**: Assess and fortify the system against potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in relation to process management and IPC.

### 7. Extensibility and Scalability

- **Modular Design Review**: Continuously review and improve the modular design of the system, ensuring that adding new commands or functionalities is straightforward and does not require extensive refactoring.
- **Performance Optimization**: Evaluate the system's performance, especially under load, and optimize resource usage and processing logic to handle increased demand efficiently.

### 8. Testing and Documentation

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Develop a suite of unit and integration tests to cover the system's functionality, focusing on the robustness of command processing and inter-module interactions.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation, including this TODO list, up-to-date with system changes and development progress. Expand documentation to include usage examples, configuration instructions, and deployment guidelines.

Addressing these TODO items will significantly advance the development of the `ProcessManage
